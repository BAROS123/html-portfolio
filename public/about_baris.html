<p>Stay straight when the trail intersects with a doubletrack and then bear left at an intersection with the winter/horse route. Narrow in places and twisty througout, this leg churner is sure to keep you on you toes. Awesome with a couple really dry spots in corners. It's mostly a hike-a-bike up and then has an advanced all-mountain feel coming down. As the valley begins to close, the route transitions to a section of open forest.</p>

<p>Fast and flowing with big jump options and some pretty crazy gap jumps. Fun and all down when coming off the top. The decent is even more steep and exposed. I discovered this trail while out with my friend one day. This is a classic Black Mountain trail and was featured in Freehub Magazine's Pisgah Photo Book: Issue 6.</p>

<p>Parking at the bottom is near mile 12 of Palmer Fishhook Road, while the top of the trailhead starts near mile 16 of Palmer Fishhook Road. Unpacked snow and mud throughout. This trail is now a designated one way from the Lee's Train/C$ intersection. Sight lines are fantastic and the flow is amazing. A little overgrown on the seward side, but totlaly manageable.</p>
